Made this chess bot for A-level coursework and after moving it to new computer unity shat itself and can't open it.
The code barely works anyway as i didn't finish it before the deadline to my standard so the king has some bugs.
barring that its written poorly and is slow. Did make a barely function Bot to play against though.
was fun though so yeah copy it if you want
