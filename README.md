Made this chess bot for A-level coursework and after moving it to new computer unity shat itself and can't open it.
the code barely works anyway as i didn't finish it before the deadline to my standard so the king has some bugs.
barring that its written poorly and is slow.
was fun though so yeah copy it if you want
